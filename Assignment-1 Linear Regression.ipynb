    "In linear regression, error refers to the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable (Y) and the predicted value of the dependent variable based on the regression line. It captures the imperfections of the model,  because the real world relationship between variables is rarely perfectly linear.\n",

A positive residual means the actual value was higher than predicted, and a negative residual means the actual value was lower than predicted.\n",

It acknowledges that there are factors other than the independent variable (X) influencing the dependent variable (Y). The error term itself isn't directly calculated, but we use various metrics to estimate the overall error in the model.\n",

    "1. **Errors:** We define error as the difference between an actual Y value (from your data) and the predicted Y value based on the regression line.\n",
    "2. **Squaring the Error:**  We square this difference (error term) to get the squared error. Squaring has two key effects:\n",
    "    * **Removes negativity:** Since errors can be positive or negative, squaring ensures all squared errors are positive values. This allows for easier summation and averaging.\n",
    "    * **Weights larger errors:** Squaring emphasizes larger errors (bigger differences) more than smaller ones. This is because the squared value increases more rapidly than the absolute value as the error gets bigger. \n",

    "\n",
    "While we don't directly use squared error as a metric, it forms the basis for some key error measurement techniques in linear regression:\n",

    "2. **Least squares regression:** This is the method used to find the best-fit line for your data in linear regression. It essentially minimizes the sum of squared errors from all data points. By fitting the line such that the total squared error is minimized, we achieve the closest possible fit according to this metric.\n",
